# Who I am and where I came from

First off, replace "Insert Name Here" in the YAML header with your name.
It has to be surrounded by double quotation marks. 
Briefly tell us a little background about yourself, and how
you ended up becoming a student at CSU and taking this class.
Put in a hypertext link to your undergraduate institution.  

Include a numbered list of your top-four favorite leisure activities, like this:

1. My favorite
1. Second favorite
1. third favorite
1. fourth favorite


Include a picture (jpg or png) of yourself, to get some practice in inserting
images into RMarkdown. See the example to see how that can be done.
Note that JPEGs that include EXIF information might be incorrectly rotated.
That is OK if you can't figure out how to fix it.





# Research Interests

Brief description of your research interests.

## Influential papers

Describe two papers that have been very influential in your
research.  The main purpose of this is learning how to
cite literature in RMarkdown.  You will have to add the citations
to `references.bib` in BibTeX format, and then also cite them.

An easy way to get the paper in BibTeX format is to find it on
Google Scholar.  Then, under the paper's link, click on the big 
fat quotation marks, and then choose the BibTex link at the bottom
of the page.  Then copy the contents into `references.bib`.  For example
you might paste this into `references.bib`.
```
@article{richardson1997bayesian,
  title={On Bayesian analysis of mixtures with an unknown number of components (with discussion)},
  author={Richardson, Sylvia and Green, Peter J},
  journal={Journal of the Royal Statistical Society: series B (statistical methodology)},
  volume={59},
  number={4},
  pages={731--792},
  year={1997},
  publisher={Wiley Online Library}
}
```
Note the string before the comma on the first line.  That is the cite key.
Once you have done that, you can cite it by including `@richardson1997bayesian`
if you don't want the name in parenthesis, like, "As @richardson1997bayesian introduced in
their landmark paper."  On the other hand, you can use `[@richardson1997bayesian]` if
you do want it all in parentheses, like, "Reversible jump MCMC has been previously applied
to the analysis of mixtures [@richardson1997bayesian]."


## The mathematics behind my research

It is easy to write complex mathematics using a mathematical typesetting
engine called TeX.  Write two displayed equations that are relevant
to your work.  For a quick primer on TeX and LaTeX you can
download [this cheatsheet](https://users.dickinson.edu/~richesod/latex/latexcheatsheet.pdf)
and then fiddle with including things between the double dollar signs below:
$$
\cos\theta + i\sin\theta = e^{i\theta}
$$
or here:
$$
\lim_{n\rightarrow \infty} \frac{1}{n}\sum_{i=1}^n X_i = EX
$$

## My computing experience

Describe any experience you have with any programming languages.
Include a snippet of code in two different languages using a
non-evaluated code block.  This can be something you have previously
written, or, if you don't have any, then find and copy a few lines of code
off the web.

## What I hope to get out of this class

Give me a bullet list of three things:

* This
* That
* Another

# Evaluating some R code

Here, please evaluate some R code to make a plot or a figure.
The goal here is just to realize that you can imbed R code
within fenced code blocks and get the output rendered into
the document.
